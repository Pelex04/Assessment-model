Assessment-model
Overview
The Assessment-model is a web-based application for managing academic records and assessments at a university. It supports administrators, lecturers, and students. Administrators manage users, courses, and programs; lecturers assign and compute grades; and students view their enrolled subjects, grades, and academic progress. A reporting module provides insights into academic performance.
